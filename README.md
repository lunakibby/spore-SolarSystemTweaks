# Solar-System Tweaks
Solar-System Tweaks is a SPOREâ„¢ mod that changes how the galaxy generates new systems. It creates a more realistic distribution that feels just like Vanilla!

### Vanilla+ Option
- Systems can have a planet count between 1 & 11
- Terrestrial Planets are more likely to have moons (15%) & rings (22%)
- Gas Giants are more likely to have moons (94%) but less likely to have rings (33%)
- Asteroid belts are more common
- T1 planets are much rarer, but T2 planets are slightly more common
- Easter Egg Worlds are slightly less common to balance with higher planet counts overall

## Mod Variations
This mod includes other replacement packages that alter the experience from a vanilla game, these are a refreshing way to play Space Stage

### Vanilla+ w/ Reduced Grox Option
- This is the same as Vanilla+, but with an addition to reduce the Grox's influence from 200 parsecs around the core to just 75

### Vanilla+ w/ Extra-Reduced Grox Option
- This is the same as Vanilla+, but with an addition to reduce the Grox's influence from 200 parsecs around the core to just 35

### Special: Wonderland Galaxy
- This swaps the values of easter-egg planets & barren T0 planets around, creating a galaxy filled with special worlds. (This is severely OP)

### Special: Cramped Galaxy
- This makes your game spawn more aliens in general, making space fairly cramped
- Lore: Your species took so long to evolve that they ended up missing most of galactic history, & now aliens seem to be literally everywhere!

### Special: Sparse Galaxy
- This makes your game spawn less aliens in general, giving empires more breathing room
- Lore: Your species was rather quick to evolve, managing to evolve before most other species could, allowing you to shape galactic history!

### Special: Progenitor
- This dramatically reduces the games ability to spawn alien empires to almost never spawn spacefaring species, you get to watch idle as the other species are still tribal or have no interest in space! (This is a very difficult start)
- Lore: Your species was first if not THE first to evolve on the galactic stage, you are the precursor species that will leave unusual technology behind!

Please note that the Sparse, Cramped & Progenitor variations are not as drastic of a change as I wanted them to be, will investigate further
